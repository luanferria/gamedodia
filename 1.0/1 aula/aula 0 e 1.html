<p>No One Like You </br> </br> </br> </p>

<P>
Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart </br> 
Much too long for a man who needs love </br> 
I miss you since I've been away </br> 
Babe, it wasn't easy to leave you alone </br> 
It's getting harder each time that I go </br> 
If I had the choice, I would stay </br>  </br> 
</P>
<P>
There's no one like you </br> 
I can't wait for the nights with you </br> 
I imagine the things we'll do </br> 
I just want to be loved by you </br>  </br> 
</P>
<P>
No one like you </br> 
I can't wait for the nights with you </br> 
I imagine the things we'll do </br> 
I just want to be loved by you </br>  </br> 
</P>
<P>
Girl, there are really no words strong enough </br> 
To describe all my longing for love </br> 
I don't want my feelings restrained </br> 
Oh babe, I just need you like never before </br> 
I just imagine you'd come through this door </br> 
You'd take all my sorrow away </br>  </br> 
</P>
<P>
There's no one like you </br> 
I can't wait for the nights with you </br> 
I imagine the things we'll do </br> 
I just want to be loved by you </br>  </br> 
</P>
<P>
No one like you </br> 
I can't wait for the nights with you </br> 
I imagine the things we'll do </br> 
I just want to be loved by you </br>  </br> 
</P>
<P>
No one like you </br> 
I can't wait for the nights with you </br> 
I imagine the things we'll do </br> 
I just want to be loved by you </br>  </br> 
</P>
<P>
No one like you </br> 
I can't wait for the nights with you </br> 
I imagine the things we'll do </br> 
I just want to be loved by you </br>  </br>
